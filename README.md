## Jobs Board App

This app was created under the tutorial 12 web apps in 12 weeks by Mackenzie Child (@mackenziechild). This is the number 7 of the series but I'm not doing in exact order, I choose according with my curiosity and needs.

### Project Planning

* There will be a homepage which will be a list of Jobs
* There will be an area to add jobs
* There will be an area to edit and delete
* Users will click on the job title and it will lead to a page where:
 * they will see the complete description of the job
 * there will be a button to apply for the job
* The jobs will have one category each
* Users will be able to search by category

#### Still to be done:
* Add users and company users. done!
* Add admin user
* Add payment method to charge companies to posts
* Add pagination
